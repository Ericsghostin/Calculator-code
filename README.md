Simple Calculator 
This is a basic command-line calculator built using Python.
It allows the user to perform four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

How it works:
The program asks the user to enter two numbers.
The user then selects an operation by typing plus, minus, star, or slash.
The calculator calculates and shows the result.
It also checks for division by zero and tells the user if the operation chosen is not valid
